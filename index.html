                Hey, I am a German young man who programs as a hobby. I program all sorts of things, but most of all I am involved in web development.
                But I also program other things, like software with Python, but also bots are my favorites.
                I still go to school and do the whole thing as I said hobbyistically, but even young people can get something going!</p>
